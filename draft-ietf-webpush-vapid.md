--- abstract

An application server can use the method described to voluntarily identify
itself to a push service.  This identification information can be used by the
push service to attribute requests that are made by the same application server
to a single entity.  An application server can include additional information
that the operator of a push service can use to contact the operator of the
application server.  This identification information can be used to restrict the
use of a push subscription to a single application server.

# Introduction

The Web Push protocol {{!RFC8030}} describes how an application
server is able to request that a push service deliver a push message to a user
agent.

As a consequence of the expected deployment architecture, there is no basis for
an application server to be known to a push service prior to requesting delivery
of a push message.  Requiring that the push service be able to authenticate
application servers places an unwanted constraint on the interactions between
user agents and application servers, who are the ultimate users of a push
service.  That constraint would also degrade the privacy-preserving properties
the protocol provides.  For these reasons, {{!RFC8030}} does not
define a mandatory system for authentication of application servers.

An unfortunate consequence of this design is that a push service is exposed to a
greater risk of denial of service attack.  While requests from application
servers can be indirectly attributed to user agents, this is not always
efficient or even sufficient.  Providing more information about the application
server directly to a push service allows the push service to better distinguish
between legitimate and bogus requests.

Additionally, the design of RFC 8030 relies considerably on the secrecy of push
subscription URIs.  Any application server in possession of this URI is able to
send messages to the user agent.  If use of a subscription could be limited to
a single application server, this would reduce the impact of the push
subscription URI being learned by an unauthorized party.


## Voluntary Identification

This document describes a system whereby an application server can volunteer
information about itself to a push service.  At a minimum, this provides a
stable identity for the application server, though this could also include
contact information, such as an email address.

A consistent identity can be used by a push service to establish behavioral
expectations for an application server.  Significant deviations from an
established norm can then be used to trigger exception handling procedures.

Voluntarily-provided contact information can be used to contact an application
server operator in the case of exceptional situations.

Experience with push service deployment has shown that software errors or
unusual circumstances can cause large increases in push message volume.
Contacting the operator of the application server has proven to be valuable.

Even in the absence of usable contact information, an application server that
has a well-established reputation might be given preference over an unidentified
application server when choosing whether to discard a push message.


## Notational Conventions

The words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", and "MAY" are used in this document.
When they are capitalized, they have the special meaning described in
{{!RFC2119}}.

The terms "push message", "push service", "push subscription", "application
server", and "user agent" are used as defined in {{!RFC8030}}.


# Application Server Self-Identification {#jwt}

Application servers that wish to self-identify generate and maintain a signing
key pair.  This key pair MUST be usable with elliptic curve digital signature
(ECDSA) over the P-256 curve {{FIPS186}}.  Use of this key when sending push
messages establishes an identity for the application server that is consistent
across multiple messages.

When requesting delivery of a push message, the application includes a JSON Web
Token (JWT) {{!RFC7519}}, signed using its signing key.  The token includes a
number of claims as follows:

 * An "aud" (Audience) claim in the token MUST include the unicode serialization
   of the origin (Section 6.1 of {{!RFC6454}}) of the push resource URL.  This
   binds the token to a specific push service.  This ensures that the token is
   reusable for all push resource URLs that share the same origin.

 * An "exp" (Expiry) claim MUST be included with the time after which the token
   expires.  This limits the time over which a token is valid.  An "exp" claim
   MUST NOT be more than 24 hours from the time of the request.  Limiting this
   to 24 hours balances the need for reuse against the potential cost and
   likelihood of theft of a valid token.

This JWT is included in an Authorization header field, using an auth-scheme of
"vapid".  A push service MAY reject a request with a 403 (Forbidden) status
code {{!RFC7235}} if the JWT signature or its claims are invalid.

The JWT MUST use a JSON Web Signature (JWS) {{!RFC7515}}.  The signature MUST
use ECDSA on the NIST P-256 curve {{FIPS186}} which is identified as "ES256"
{{!RFC7518}}.


## Application Server Contact Information

If the application server wishes to provide contact details it MAY include a
"sub" (Subject) claim in the JWT.  The "sub" claim SHOULD include a contact URI
for the application server as either a "mailto:" (email) {{!RFC6068}} or an
"https:" {{!RFC2818}} URI.


## Additional Claims

An application server MAY include additional claims using public or private
names (see Sections 4.2 and 4.3 of {{!RFC7519}}).  Since the JWT is in a header
field, the size of additional claims SHOULD be kept as small as possible.


## Cryptographic Agility

The "vapid" authentication scheme is used to identify the specific profile of
JWT defined in this document.  A different authentication scheme is needed to
update the signature algorithm or other parameters.  This ensures that existing
mechanisms for negotiating authentication scheme can be used rather than
defining new parameter negotiation mechanisms.


## Example

An application server requests the delivery of a push message as described in
{{!RFC8030}}.  If the application server wishes to self-identify,
it includes an Authorization header field with credentials that use the
"vapid" authentication scheme ({{auth}}).

# Vapid Authentication Scheme {#auth}

A new "vapid" HTTP authentication scheme {{!RFC7235}} is defined.  This
authentication scheme carries a signed JWT, as described in {{jwt}}, plus the
key that signed that JWT.

This authentication scheme is for origin-server authentication only.  Therefore,
this authentication scheme MUST NOT be used with the Proxy-Authenticate or
Proxy-Authorization header fields.

This authentication scheme does not require a challenge.  Clients are able to
generate the Authorization header field without any additional information from
a server.  Therefore, a challenge for this authentication scheme MUST NOT be
sent in a WWW-Authenticate header field.

Two parameters are defined for this authentication scheme: `t` and `k`.  All
unknown or unsupported parameters to "vapid" authentication credentials MUST
be ignored.  The `realm` parameter is ignored for this authentication scheme.

This authentication scheme is intended for use by an application server when
using the Web Push protocol {{?RFC8030}}, but it could be
used in other contexts if applicable.


## Token Parameter (t) {#token}

The `t` parameter of the "vapid" authentication scheme carries a JWT as
described in {{jwt}}.


## Public Key Parameter (k) {#key}

In order for the push service to be able to validate the JWT, it needs to learn
the public key of the application server.  A `k` parameter is defined for the
"vapid" authentication scheme to carry this information.

The `k` parameter includes an elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA)
public key {{FIPS186}} in uncompressed form {{X9.62}} that is encoded using
base64url encoding {{!RFC7515}}.

Note:

: X9.62 encoding is used over JWK {{?RFC7517}} for two reasons.  A JWK does not
  have a canonical form, so X9.62 encoding makes it easier for the push service
  to handle comparison of keys from different sources.  Secondarily, the X9.62
  encoding is also considerably smaller.

Some implementations permit the same P-256 key to be used for signing and key
exchange.  An application server MUST select a different private key for the key
exchange {{?I-D.ietf-webpush-encryption}} and signing the authentication token.
Though a push service is not obligated to check either parameter for every push
message, a push service SHOULD reject push messages that have identical values
for these parameters with a 400 (Bad Request) status code.


# Subscription Restriction {#restrict}

The public key of the application server serves as a stable identifier for the
server.  This key can be used to restrict a push subscription to a specific
application server.

Subscription restriction reduces the reliance on endpoint secrecy by requiring
proof of possession to be demonstrated by an application server when requesting
delivery of a push message.  This provides an additional level of protection
against leaking of the details of the push subscription.


## Creating a Restricted Push Subscription

The user agent includes the public key of the application server when requesting
the creation of a push subscription.  This restricts use of the resulting
subscription to application servers that are able to provide proof of possession
for the corresponding private key.

The public key is then added to the request to create a push subscription.  The
push subscription request is extended to include a body.  The body of the
request is a JSON object as described in {{!RFC7159}}.  A "vapid" member is
added to this JSON object, containing the public key on the P-256 curve, encoded
in the uncompressed form {{X9.62}} and base64url encoded {{!RFC7515}}.  The
media type of the body is set to "application/webpush-options+json" (see
{{mime}} for registration of this media type).

A push service MUST ignore the body of a request that uses a different media
type.  For the "application/webpush-options+json" media type, a push service
MUST ignore any members on this object that it does not understand.

The example in {{ex-restrict}} shows a restriction to the key used in
{{ex-push}}.  Extra whitespace is added to meet formatting constraints.

~~~
POST /subscribe/ HTTP/1.1
Host: push.example.net
Content-Type: application/webpush-options+json
Content-Length: 104

{ "vapid": "BA1Hxzyi1RUM1b5wjxsn7nGxAszw2u61m164i3MrAIxH
            F6YK5h4SDYic-dRuU_RCPCfA5aq9ojSwk5Y2EmClBPs" }
~~~
{: #ex-restrict title="Example Subscribe Request"}

An application might use the Web Push API {{API}} to provide the user agent with
a public key.


## Using Restricted Subscriptions

When a push subscription has been associated with an application server, the
request for push message delivery MUST include proof of possession for the
associated private key that was used when creating the push subscription.

A push service MUST reject a message that omits mandatory credentials
with a 401 (Unauthorized) status code.  A push service MAY reject a message
that includes invalid credentials with a 403 (Forbidden) status code.
Credentials are invalid if:

* either the authentication token or public key are not included in the request,

* the signature on the JWT cannot be successfully verified using the included
  public key,

* the current time is later than the time identified in the "exp" (Expiry)
  claim or more than 24 hours before the expiry time,

* the origin of the push resource is not included in the "aud" (Audience) claim,
  or

* the public key used to sign the JWT doesn't match the one that was included in
  the creation of the push subscription.

A push service MUST NOT forward the JWT or public key to the user agent when
delivering the push message.

An application server that needs to replace its signing key needs to request
the creation of a new subscription by the user agent that is restricted to the
updated key.  Application servers need to remember the key that was used when
requesting the creation of a subscription.


# Security Considerations {#security}

This authentication scheme is vulnerable to replay attacks if an attacker can
acquire a valid JWT.  Applying narrow limits to the period over which a
replayable token can be reused limits the potential value of a stolen token to
an attacker and can increase the difficulty of stealing a token.

An application server might offer falsified contact information.  The
application server asserts its email address or contact URI without any
evidence to support the claim.  A push service operator cannot use the presence
of unvalidated contact information as input to any security-critical
decision-making process.

Validation of a signature on the JWT requires a non-trivial amount of
computation.  For something that might be used to identify legitimate requests
under denial of service attack conditions, this is not ideal.  Application
servers are therefore encouraged to reuse tokens, which permits the push service
to cache the results of signature validation.

An application server that changes its signing key breaks linkability between
push messages that it sends under the different keys.  A push service that
relies on a consistent identity for application servers might categorize
requests made with new keys differently.  Gradual migration to a new signing key
reduces the chances that requests that use the new key will be categorized as
abusive.
