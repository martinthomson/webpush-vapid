--- abstract

An application server can voluntarily identify itself to a push service using
the described technique.  This identification information can be used by the
push service to attribute requests that are made by the same application server
to a single entity.  This can used to reduce the secrecy for push subscription
URLs by being able to restrict subscriptions to a specific application server.
An application server is further able to include additional information that the
operator of a push service can use to contact the operator of the application
server.

# Introduction

The Web Push protocol [I-D.ietf-webpush-protocol] describes how an application
server is able to request that a push service deliver a push message to a user
agent.

As a consequence of the expected deployment architecture, there is no basis for
an application server to be known to a push service prior to requesting delivery
of a push message.  By the same measure, requesting the creation of a
subscription for push message receipts has no prior authentication.  Requiring
that the push service be able to authenticate application servers places an
unwanted constraint on the interactions between user agents and application
servers, who are the ultimate users of a push service.  That constraint would
also degrade the privacy-preserving properties the protocol provides.  For these
reasons, [I-D.ietf-webpush-protocol] does not define a mandatory system for
authentication of application servers.

An unfortunate consequence of this design is that a push service is exposed to a
greater risk of denial of service attack.  While requests from application
servers can be indirectly attributed to user agents, this is not always
efficient or even sufficient.  Providing more information about the application
server directly to a push service allows the push service to better distinguish
between legitimate and bogus requests.

Additionally, this design also relies on endpoint secrecy as any application
server in possession of the endpoint is able to send messages, albeit without
payloads.  In situations where usage of a subscription can be limited to a
single application server, the ability to associate a subscription with the
application server could reduce the impact of a data leak.


## Voluntary Identification

This document describes a system whereby an application server can volunteer
information about itself to a push service.  At a minimum, this provides a
stable identity for the application server, though this could also include
contact information, such as an email address.

A consistent identity can be used by a push service to establish behavioral
expectations for an application server.  Significant deviations from an
established norm can then be used to trigger exception handling procedures.

Voluntarily-provided contact information can be used to contact an application
server operator in the case of exceptional situations.

Experience with push service deployment has shown that software errors or
unusual circumstances can cause large increases in push message volume.
Contacting the operator of the application server has proven to be valuable.

Even in the absence of usable contact information, an application server that
has a well-established reputation might be given preference over an unidentified
application server when choosing whether to discard a push message.


## Notational Conventions

The words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", and "MAY" are used in this document.
It's not shouting, when they are capitalized, they have the special meaning
described in [RFC2119].

The terms "push message", "push service", "push subscription", "application
server", and "user agent" are used as defined in [I-D.ietf-webpush-protocol].


# Application Server Self-Identification {#jwt}

Application servers SHOULD generate and maintain a signing key pair usable with
elliptic curve digital signature (ECDSA) over the P-256 curve [FIPS186].  Use of
this key when sending push messages establishes a continuous identity for the
application server.

When requesting delivery of a push message, the application includes a JSON Web
Token (JWT) [RFC7519], signed using its signing key.  The token includes a
number of claims as follows:

 * An "aud" (Audience) claim in the token MUST include the unicode serialization
   of the origin (Section 6.1 of [RFC6454]) of the push resource URL.  This
   binds the token to a specific push service.  This ensures that the token is
   reusable for all push resource URLs that share the same origin.

 * An "exp" (Expiry) claim MUST be included with the time after which the token
   expires.  This limits the time that a token over which a token is valid.  An
   "exp" claim MUST NOT be more than 24 hours from the time of the request.

This JWT is included in an Authorization header field, using an auth-scheme of
"Bearer" [RFC6750].  A push service MAY reject a request with a 403 (Forbidden)
status code [RFC7235] if the JWT signature or its claims are invalid.

The JWT MUST use a JSON Web Signature (JWS) [RFC7515].  The signature MUST use
ECDSA on the NIST P-256 curve [FIPS186], that is "ES256" [RFC7518].


## Application Server Contact Information

If the application server wishes to provide contact details it MAY include an
"sub" (Subject) claim in the JWT.  The "sub" claim SHOULD include a contact URI
for the application server as either a "mailto:" (email) [RFC6068] or an
"https:" [RFC2818] URI.


## Example

An application server requests the delivery of a push message as described in
[I-D.ietf-webpush-protocol].  If the application server wishes to self-identify,
it includes an Authorization header field with credentials that use the "Bearer"
authentication scheme {{auth}} and a Crypto-Key header field that includes its
public key {{key}}.

Note that the header fields shown in {{ex-push}} don't include line wrapping.
Extra whitespace is added to meet formatting constraints.

The value of the Authorization header field is a base64url-encoded JWT with the
header and body shown in {{ex-jwt}}.  This JWT would be valid until
2016-01-21T01:53:25Z [RFC3339].

# Using the Bearer Authentication Scheme {#auth}

A new "Bearer" HTTP authentication scheme [RFC6750] is used for carrying the JWT
{{jwt}}.

In comparison to the usage described in [RFC6750], this token is generated by an
application server rather than being acquired from an OAuth authorization
server.  The "scope" parameter is not necessary and MUST be omitted.

This authentication scheme is for origin-server authentication only and can
therefore only be used with the Authorization header field.

This usage of "Bearer" does not require a challenge.  Clients are able to
generate the Authorization header field without any additional information from
a server.  A WWW-Authenticate header field MAY be sent in response to an
unsuccessful request that includes the authentication scheme.

All unknown or unsupported parameters to "Bearer" authentication credentials
MUST be ignored for this usage.  The `realm` parameter is ignored for this
authentication scheme.


# Public Key Representation {#key}

In order for the push service to be able to validate the JWT, it needs to learn
the public key of the application server.  A `p256ecdsa` parameter is defined
for the Crypto-Key header field [I-D.ietf-httpbis-encryption-encoding] to carry
this information.

The `p256ecdsa` parameter includes an elliptic curve digital signature algorithm
(ECDSA) public key [FIPS186] in uncompressed form [X9.62] that is encoded using
the URL- and filename-safe variant of base-64 [RFC4648] with padding removed.

Note that with push message encryption [I-D.ietf-webpush-encryption], this
results in two values in the Crypto-Key header field, one with the a `p256dh`
key and another with a `p256ecdsa` key.

Some implementations permit the same P-256 key to be used for signing and key
exchange.  An application server MUST select a different private key for the key
exchange (i.e., `p256dh`) and signing (i.e., `p256ecdsa`).  Though a push
service is not obligated to check either parameter for every push message, a
push service SHOULD reject push messages that have identical values for these
parameters with a 400 (Bad Request) status code.

Editor's Note:

: JWK [RFC7517] seems like the obvious choice here.  However, JWK doesn't define
  a compact representation for public keys, which complicates the representation
  of JWK in a header field.



# Subscription Restriction

The public key of the application server serves as a stable identifier for the
server.  This key can be used to restrict a push subscription to a specific
application server.

Subscription restriction reduces the reliance on endpoint secrecy by requiring
proof of possession to be demonstrated by an application server when requesting
delivery of a push message.  This provides an additional level of protection
against leaking of the details of the push subscription.


## Creating a Restricted Push Subscription

The user agent includes the public key of the application server when requesting
the creation of a push subscription.  This restricts use of the resulting
subscription to application servers that are able to provide proof of possession
for the corresponding private key.

This public key is then added to the request to create a push subscription as
described in {{key}}.  The Crypto-Key header field includes exactly one public
key.  For example:

~~~
POST /subscribe/ HTTP/1.1
Host: push.example.net
Crypto-Key: p256ecdsa=BBa22H8qaZ-iDMH9izb4qE72puwyvfjH2RxoQr5oiS4b
                      KImoRwJm5xK9hLrbfIik20g31z8MpLFMCMr8y2cu6gY
~~~
{: #ex-restrict title="Example Subscribe Request"}


An application might use the Web Push API [API] to include this information.
For example, the API might permit an application to provide a public key as part
of a new field on the `PushSubscriptionOptions` dictionary.


Note:

: Allowing the inclusion of multiple keys when creating a subscription would
  allow a subscription to be associated with multiple application servers or
  application server instances.  This might be more flexible, but it also would
  require more state to be maintained by the push service for each subscription.


## Using Restricted Subscriptions

When a push subscription has been associated with an application server, the
request for push message delivery MUST include proof of possession for the
associated private key that was used when creating the push subscription.

A push service MUST reject a message that omits mandatory credentials
with a 401 (Unauthorized) status code.  A push service MAY reject a message
that includes invalid credentials with a 403 (Forbidden) status code.
Credentials are invalid if:

* either the authentication credentials or public key are not included in the
  request,

* the signature on the JWT cannot be successfully verified using the included
  public key,

* the current time is later than the time identified in the "exp" (Expiry)
  claim or more than 24 hours before the expiry time,

* the origin of the push resource is not included in the "aud" (Audience) claim,
  or

* the public key used to sign the JWT doesn't match the one that was included in
  the creation of the push message.

Note:

: In theory, since the push service was given a public key, the push message
  request could omit the public key.  On balance, requiring the key keeps things
  simple and it allows push services to compress the public key (by hashing it,
  for example).  In any case, the relatively minor space savings aren't
  particularly important on the connection between the application server and
  push service.

A push service MUST NOT forward the JWT or public key to the user agent when
delivering the push message.


# Security Considerations {#security}

This authentication scheme is vulnerable to replay attacks if an attacker can
acquire a valid JWT.  Applying narrow limits to the period over which a
replayable token can be reused limits the potential value of a stolen token to
an attacker and can increase the difficulty of stealing a token.

An application server might offer falsified contact information.  A push service
operator therefore cannot use the presence of unvalidated contact information as
input to any security-critical decision-making process.

Validation of a signature on the JWT requires a non-trivial amount of
computation.  For something that might be used to identify legitimate requests
under denial of service attack conditions, this is not ideal.  Application
servers are therefore encouraged to reuse a JWT, which permits the push service
to cache the results of signature validation.


# IANA Considerations {#iana}

This document registers a `p256ecdsa` parameter for the Crypto-Key header field
in the "Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Crypto-Key Parameters" established in
[I-D.ietf-httpbis-encryption-encoding].

Parameter Name:

: p256ecdsa

Purpose:

: Conveys a public key for that is used to generate an ECDSA signature.
